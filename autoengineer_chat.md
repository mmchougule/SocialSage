You: create a new project in python with a cool name, it should be a social media content planner app that basically tracks the most engaging content in specific field like web3 crypto related content that user want to check twitter for, group them in a few categories and provide tweet thread ideas and social media content scheduler that is personalized to my needs. My goal is to enhance the user engagement by creating content intelligent and funny and comments for specific high value tweets to elevate my social status. so it's a social media content planner app that is AI driven, we can just use claude sonnet api similar to what is being used in main.py file. The main goal is have all code written for running this app.

Claude: Certainly! I'll create a new Python project for a social media content planner app focused on Web3 and crypto-related content. Let's call it "CryptoSocialSage". I'll set up the project structure and implement the main functionalities you've described. Let's get started!

<thinking>
To create this project, I'll need to:
1. Create a root folder for the project
2. Set up a basic project structure with necessary files
3. Implement the main functionality in Python
4. Use Claude API for AI-driven content generation
5. Create a simple scheduler for social media posts
6. Implement tweet analysis and categorization
7. Create a user interface (CLI for simplicity)

I'll use the create_folder and create_file tools to set up the project structure, and then write the necessary code using the write_to_file tool.
</thinking>

Let's begin by creating the project structure:

Tool Used: create_folder
Tool Input: {'path': 'CryptoSocialSage'}

Now that we have created the root folder, let's create the following files and directories:
1. main.py - The entry point of our application
2. requirements.txt - To list our project dependencies
3. config.py - To store configuration variables
4. crypto_social_sage/ - A directory to hold our main application code
   - __init__.py
   - content_analyzer.py
   - content_generator.py
